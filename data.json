SOFTWARE\u00a0DIRECTORY HARDWARE SITEMAP / Philosophy / Essays\u00a0&\u00a0articles / About\u00a0free\u00a0software / Principles / What is Free Software? \u201cFree software\u201d means software that respects users'\nfreedom and community.  Roughly, it means that the users have the\nfreedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the\nsoftware .  Thus, \u201cfree software\u201d is a matter of\nliberty, not price.  To understand the concept, you should think of\n\u201cfree\u201d as in \u201cfree speech,\u201d not as in\n\u201cfree beer.\u201d  We sometimes call it \u201clibre\nsoftware,\u201d borrowing the French or Spanish word for\n\u201cfree\u201d as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software\nis gratis. You may have paid money to get copies of a free program, or you may\nhave obtained copies at no charge.  But regardless of how you got your\ncopies, you always have the freedom to copy and change the software,\neven to sell copies . We campaign for these freedoms because everyone deserves them.  With\nthese freedoms, the users (both individually and collectively) control\nthe program and what it does for them.  When users don't control the\nprogram, we call it a \u201cnonfree\u201d or\n\u201cproprietary\u201d program.  The nonfree program controls the\nusers, and the developer controls the program; this makes the\nprogram an instrument of unjust power . \u201cOpen source\u201d is something different: it has a very\ndifferent philosophy based on different values.  Its practical\ndefinition is different too, but nearly all open source programs are\nin fact free.  We explain the\ndifference in Why \u201cOpen Source\u201d misses the point of Free Software . Table of contents The Free Software Definition The four essential freedoms Free software can be commercial Clarifying the Boundary Between Free and Nonfree The freedom to run the program as you\n     wish The freedom to study the source code and make\n     changes The freedom to redistribute if you wish:\n     basic requirements Copyleft Rules about packaging and distribution\n     details Export regulations Legal considerations Contract-based licenses The Free Software Definition in Practice How we interpret these criteria Get help with free licenses Use the right words when talking about free\n     software Beyond Software History Have a question about free software licensing not answered here?\nSee our other licensing resources ,\nand if necessary contact the FSF Compliance Lab\nat licensing@fsf.org . The Free Software Definition The free software definition presents the criteria for whether a\nparticular software program qualifies as free software.  From time to\ntime we revise this definition, to clarify it or to resolve questions\nabout subtle issues.  See the History section below for a list of changes that affect the definition of free\nsoftware. The four essential freedoms A program is free software if the program's users have the\nfour essential freedoms: [1] The freedom to run the program as you wish,\n      for any purpose (freedom 0). The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it\n      does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source\n      code is a precondition for this. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others\n      (freedom 2). The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions\n      to others (freedom 3).  By doing this you can give the whole\n      community a chance to benefit from your changes.\n      Access to the source code is a precondition for this. A program is free software if it gives users adequately all of these\nfreedoms.  Otherwise, it is nonfree.  While we can distinguish various\nnonfree distribution schemes in terms of how far they fall short of\nbeing free, we consider them all equally unethical. In any given scenario, these freedoms must apply to whatever code\nwe plan to make use of, or lead others to make use of.  For instance,\nconsider a program A which automatically launches a program B to\nhandle some cases.  If we plan to distribute A as it stands, that\nimplies users will need B, so we need to judge whether both A and B\nare free.  However, if we plan to modify A so that it doesn't use B,\nonly A needs to be free; B is not pertinent to that plan. Free software can be commercial \u201cFree software\u201d does not mean \u201cnoncommercial.\u201d\nOn the contrary, a free program must be available for commercial use,\ncommercial development, and commercial distribution.  This policy is\nof fundamental importance\u2014without this, free software could not\nachieve its aims. We want to invite everyone to use the GNU system, including businesses\nand their workers.  That requires allowing commercial use.  We hope\nthat free replacement programs will supplant comparable proprietary\nprograms, but they can't do that if businesses are forbidden to use\nthem.  We want commercial products that contain software to include\nthe GNU system, and that would constitute commercial distribution for\na price.  Commercial development of free software is no longer\nunusual; such free commercial software is very important.  Paid,\nprofessional support for free software fills an important need. Thus, to exclude commercial use, commercial development or commercial\ndistribution would hobble the free software community and obstruct its\npath to success.  We must conclude that a program licensed with such\nrestrictions does not qualify as free software. A free program must offer the four freedoms to any would-be user that\nobtains a copy of the software, who has complied thus far with the\nconditions of the free license covering the software in any previous\ndistribution of it.  Putting some of the freedoms off limits to some\nusers, or requiring that users pay, in money or in kind, to exercise\nthem, is tantamount to not granting the freedoms in question, and thus\nrenders the program nonfree. Clarifying the Boundary Between Free and Nonfree In the rest of this article we explain more precisely how far the\nvarious freedoms need to extend, on various issues, in order for a\nprogram to be free. The freedom to run the program as you wish The freedom to run the program means the freedom for any kind of person\nor organization to use it on any kind of computer system, for any kind of\noverall job and purpose, without being required to communicate about it\nwith the developer or any other specific entity.  In this freedom, it is\nthe user's purpose that matters, not the developer's purpose; you as a user are free to run the program for your purposes,\nand if you distribute it to other people, they are then free to run it for\ntheir purposes, but you are not entitled to impose your purposes on them. The freedom to run the program as you wish means that you are not\nforbidden or stopped from making it run.  This has nothing to do with what\nfunctionality the program has, whether it is technically capable of\nfunctioning in any given environment, or whether it is useful for any\nparticular computing activity. For example, if the code arbitrarily rejects certain meaningful\ninputs\u2014or even fails unconditionally\u2014that may make the\nprogram less useful, perhaps even totally useless, but it does not\ndeny users the freedom to run the program, so it does not conflict\nwith freedom 0.  If the program is free, the users can overcome the\nloss of usefulness, because freedoms 1 and 3 permit users and\ncommunities to make and distribute modified versions without the\narbitrary nuisance code. \u201cAs you wish\u201d includes, optionally, \u201cnot at\nall\u201d if that is what you wish.  So there is no need for a\nseparate \u201cfreedom not to run a program.\u201d The freedom to study the source code and make changes In order for freedoms 1 and 3 (the freedom to make changes and the\nfreedom to publish the changed versions) to be meaningful, you need to have\naccess to the source code of the program.  Therefore, accessibility of\nsource code is a necessary condition for free software.  Obfuscated\n\u201csource code\u201d is not real source code and does not count\nas source code. Source code is defined as the preferred form of the program for making\nchanges in.  Thus, whatever form a developer changes to develop\nthe program is the source code of that developer's version. Freedom 1 includes the freedom to use your changed version in place of\nthe original.  If the program is delivered in a product designed to\nrun someone else's modified versions but refuse to run yours\u2014a\npractice known as \u201ctivoization\u201d or \u201clockdown,\u201d\nor (in its practitioners' perverse terminology) as \u201csecure\nboot\u201d\u2014freedom 1 becomes an empty pretense rather than a\npractical reality.  These binaries are not free\nsoftware even if the source code they are compiled from is free. One important way to modify a program is by merging in available free\nsubroutines and modules.  If the program's license says that you\ncannot merge in a suitably licensed existing module\u2014for instance, if it\nrequires you to be the copyright holder of any code you add\u2014then the\nlicense is too restrictive to qualify as free. Whether a change constitutes an improvement is a subjective matter.\nIf your right to modify a program is limited, in substance, to changes that\nsomeone else considers an improvement, that program is not free. One special case of freedom 1 is to delete the program's code so it\nreturns after doing nothing, or make it invoke some other program.\nThus, freedom 1 includes the \u201cfreedom to delete the program.\u201d The freedom to redistribute if you wish: basic\nrequirements Freedom to distribute (freedoms 2 and 3) means you are free to\nredistribute copies, either with or without modifications, either\ngratis or charging a fee for distribution, to anyone anywhere .  Being free to do these\nthings means (among other things) that you do not have to ask or pay\nfor permission to do so. You should also have the freedom to make modifications and use them\nprivately in your own work or play, without even mentioning that they\nexist.  If you do publish your changes, you should not be required to\nnotify anyone in particular, or in any particular way. Freedom 3 includes the freedom to release your modified versions\nas free software.  A free license may also permit other ways of\nreleasing them; in other words, it does not have to be\na copyleft license.  However, a\nlicense that requires modified versions to be nonfree does not qualify\nas a free license. The freedom to redistribute copies must include binary or executable\nforms of the program, as well as source code, for both modified and\nunmodified versions.  (Distributing programs in runnable form is necessary\nfor conveniently installable free operating systems.)  It is OK if there\nis no way to produce a binary or executable form for a certain program\n(since some languages don't support that feature), but you must have the\nfreedom to redistribute such forms should you find or develop a way to\nmake them. Copyleft Certain kinds of rules about the manner of distributing free\nsoftware are acceptable, when they don't conflict with the central\nfreedoms.  For example, copyleft (very simply stated) is the rule that when redistributing the program,\nyou cannot add restrictions to deny other people the central freedoms.\nThis rule does not conflict with the central freedoms; rather it\nprotects them. In the GNU project, we use copyleft to protect the four freedoms\nlegally for everyone.  We believe there are important reasons why it is better to use\ncopyleft .  However, noncopylefted free software is ethical\ntoo.  See Categories of Free\nSoftware for a description of how \u201cfree software,\u201d\n\u201ccopylefted software\u201d and other categories of software\nrelate to each other. Rules about packaging and distribution details Rules about how to package a modified version are acceptable,\nif they don't substantively limit your freedom to release modified\nversions, or your freedom to make and use modified versions privately.\nThus, it is acceptable for the license to require that you change the\nname of the modified version, remove a logo, or identify your\nmodifications as yours.  As long as these requirements are not so\nburdensome that they effectively hamper you from releasing your\nchanges, they are acceptable; you're already making other changes to\nthe program, so you won't have trouble making a few more. Rules that \u201cif you make your version available in this way, you\nmust make it available in that way also\u201d can be acceptable too,\non the same condition.  An example of such an acceptable rule is one\nsaying that if you have distributed a\nmodified version and a previous developer asks for a copy of it, you\nmust send one.  (Note that such a rule still leaves you the choice of\nwhether to distribute your version at all.)  Rules that require release\nof source code to the users for versions that you put into public use\nare also acceptable. A special issue arises when a license requires changing the name by\nwhich the program will be invoked from other programs.  That\neffectively hampers you from releasing your changed version so that it\ncan replace the original when invoked by those other programs.  This\nsort of requirement is acceptable only if there's a suitable aliasing\nfacility that allows you to specify the original program's name as an\nalias for the modified version. Export regulations Sometimes government export control regulations\nand trade sanctions can constrain your freedom to distribute copies of\nprograms internationally.  Software developers do not have the power to\neliminate or override these restrictions, but what they can and must do\nis refuse to impose them as conditions of use of the program.  In this\nway, the restrictions will not affect activities and people outside the\njurisdictions of these governments.  Thus, free software licenses\nmust not require obedience to any nontrivial export regulations as a\ncondition of exercising any of the essential freedoms. Merely mentioning the existence of export regulations, without making\nthem a condition of the license itself, is acceptable since it does\nnot restrict users.  If an export regulation is actually trivial for\nfree software, then requiring it as a condition is not an actual\nproblem; however, it is a potential problem, since a later change in\nexport law could make the requirement nontrivial and thus render the\nsoftware nonfree. Legal considerations In order for these freedoms to be real, they must be permanent and\nirrevocable as long as you do nothing wrong; if the developer of the\nsoftware has the power to revoke the license, or retroactively add\nrestrictions to its terms, without your doing anything wrong to give\ncause, the software is not free. A free license may not require compliance with the license of a\nnonfree program.  Thus, for instance, if a license requires you to\ncomply with the licenses of \u201call the programs you use,\u201d in\nthe case of a user that runs nonfree programs this would require\ncompliance with the licenses of those nonfree programs; that makes the\nlicense nonfree. It is acceptable for a free license to specify which jurisdiction's\nlaw applies, or where litigation must be done, or both. Contract-based licenses Most free software licenses are based on copyright, and there are limits\non what kinds of requirements can be imposed through copyright.  If a\ncopyright-based license respects freedom in the ways described above, it\nis unlikely to have some other sort of problem that we never anticipated\n(though this does happen occasionally).  However, some free software\nlicenses are based on contracts, and contracts can impose a much larger\nrange of possible restrictions.  That means there are many possible ways\nsuch a license could be unacceptably restrictive and nonfree. We can't possibly list all the ways that might happen.  If a\ncontract-based license restricts the user in an unusual way that\ncopyright-based licenses cannot, and which isn't mentioned here as\nlegitimate, we will have to think about it, and we will probably conclude\nit is nonfree. The Free Software Definition in Practice How we interpret these criteria Note that criteria such as those stated in this free software\ndefinition require careful thought for their interpretation.  To decide\nwhether a specific software license qualifies as a free software license,\nwe judge it based on these criteria to determine whether it fits their\nspirit as well as the precise words.  If a license includes unconscionable\nrestrictions, we reject it, even if we did not anticipate the issue\nin these criteria.  Sometimes a license requirement raises an issue\nthat calls for extensive thought, including discussions with a lawyer,\nbefore we can decide if the requirement is acceptable.  When we reach\na conclusion about a new issue, we often update these criteria to make\nit easier to see why certain licenses do or don't qualify. Get help with free licenses If you are interested in whether a specific license qualifies as a free\nsoftware license, see our list\nof licenses .  If the license you are concerned with is not\nlisted there, you can ask us about it by sending us email at <licensing@gnu.org> . If you are contemplating writing a new license, please contact the\nFree Software Foundation first by writing to that address. The\nproliferation of different free software licenses means increased work\nfor users in understanding the licenses; we may be able to help you\nfind an existing free software license that meets your needs. If that isn't possible, if you really need a new license, with our\nhelp you can ensure that the license really is a free software license\nand avoid various practical problems. Use the right words when talking about free software When talking about free software, it is best to avoid using terms\nlike \u201cgive away\u201d or \u201cfor free,\u201d because those terms imply that\nthe issue is about price, not freedom.  Some common terms such\nas \u201cpiracy\u201d embody opinions we hope you won't endorse.  See Confusing Words and Phrases that\nare Worth Avoiding for a discussion of these terms.  We also have\na list of proper translations of\n\u201cfree software\u201d into various languages. Another group uses the term \u201copen source\u201d to mean\nsomething close (but not identical) to \u201cfree software.\u201d  We\nprefer the term \u201cfree software\u201d because, once you have heard that\nit refers to freedom rather than price, it calls to mind freedom.  The\nword \u201copen\u201d never refers to freedom. Beyond Software Software manuals must be free ,\nfor the same reasons that software must be free, and because the\nmanuals are in effect part of the software. The same arguments also make sense for other kinds of works of\npractical use\u2014that is to say, works that embody useful knowledge,\nsuch as educational works and reference\nworks. Wikipedia is the best-known\nexample. Any kind of work can be free, and the definition of free software\nhas been extended to a definition of free cultural works applicable to any kind of works. History From time to time we revise this Free Software Definition.  Here is\nthe list of substantive changes, along with links to show exactly what\nwas changed. Version\n1.169 : Explain more clearly why the four freedoms must apply\nto commercial activity.  Explain why the four freedoms imply the\nfreedom not to run the program and the freedom to delete it, so there\nis no need to state those as separate requirements. Version\n1.165 : Clarify that arbitrary annoyances in the code do not\nnegate freedom 0, and that freedoms 1 and 3 enable users to remove them. Version\n1.153 : Clarify that freedom to run the program means nothing stops\nyou from making it run. Version\n1.141 : Clarify which code needs to be free. Version\n1.135 : Say each time that freedom 0 is the freedom to run the program\nas you wish. Version\n1.134 : Freedom 0 is not a matter of the program's functionality. Version\n1.131 : A free license may not require compliance with a nonfree license\nof another program. Version\n1.129 : State explicitly that choice of law and choice of forum\nspecifications are allowed.  (This was always our policy.) Version\n1.122 : An export control requirement is a real problem if the\nrequirement is nontrivial; otherwise it is only a potential problem. Version\n1.118 : Clarification: the issue is limits on your right to modify,\nnot on what modifications you have made.  And modifications are not limited\nto \u201cimprovements\u201d Version\n1.111 : Clarify 1.77 by saying that only\nretroactive restrictions are unacceptable.  The copyright\nholders can always grant additional permission for use of the\nwork by releasing the work in another way in parallel. Version\n1.105 : Reflect, in the brief statement of freedom 1, the point\n(already stated in version 1.80) that it includes really using your modified\nversion for your computing. Version\n1.92 : Clarify that obfuscated code does not qualify as source code. Version\n1.90 : Clarify that freedom 3 means the right to distribute copies\nof your own modified or improved version, not a right to participate\nin someone else's development project. Version\n1.89 : Freedom 3 includes the right to release modified versions as\nfree software. Version\n1.80 : Freedom 1 must be practical, not just theoretical;\ni.e., no tivoization. Version\n1.77 : Clarify that all retroactive changes to the license are\nunacceptable, even if it's not described as a complete\nreplacement. Version\n1.74 : Four clarifications of points not explicit enough, or stated\nin some places but not reflected everywhere: \u201cImprovements\u201d does not mean the license can\nsubstantively limit what kinds of modified versions you can release.\nFreedom 3 includes distributing modified versions, not just changes. The right to merge in existing modules\nrefers to those that are suitably licensed. Explicitly state the conclusion of the point about export controls. Imposing a license change constitutes revoking the old license. Version\n1.57 : Add \u201cBeyond Software\u201d section. Version\n1.46 : Clarify whose purpose is significant in the freedom to run\nthe program for any purpose. Version\n1.41 : Clarify wording about contract-based licenses. Version\n1.40 : Explain that a free license must allow to you use other\navailable free software to create your modifications. Version\n1.39 : Note that it is acceptable for a license to require you to\nprovide source for versions of the software you put into public\nuse. Version\n1.31 : Note that it is acceptable for a license to require you to\nidentify yourself as the author of modifications.  Other minor\nclarifications throughout the text. Version\n1.23 : Address potential problems related to contract-based\nlicenses. Version\n1.16 : Explain why distribution of binaries is important. Version\n1.11 : Note that a free license may require you to send a copy of\nversions you distribute to previous developers on request. There are gaps in the version numbers shown above because there are\nother changes in this page that do not affect the definition or its\ninterpretations.  For instance, the list does not include changes in\nasides, formatting, spelling, punctuation, or other parts of the page.\nYou can review the complete list of changes to the page through\nthe cvsweb\ninterface . Footnote The reason they are numbered 0, 1, 2 and 3 is historical. Around\n1990 there were three freedoms, numbered 1, 2 and 3. Then we realized that\nthe freedom to run the program needed to be mentioned explicitly.\nIt was clearly more basic than the other three, so it properly should\nprecede them. Rather than renumber the others, we made it freedom\u00a00. \u25b2 BACK TO TOP Set language Available for this page: [en] English [af] Afrikaans [ar] \u00d8\u00a7\u00d9\u0084\u00d8\u00b9\u00d8\u00b1\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9\u008a\u00d8\u00a9 [az] Az\u00c9\u0099rbaycanca [bg] \u00d0\u00b1\u00d1\u008a\u00d0\u00bb\u00d0\u00b3\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\u0080\u00d1\u0081\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b8 [bn] \u00e0\u00a6\u00ac\u00e0\u00a6\u00be\u00e0\u00a6\u0082\u00e0\u00a6\u00b2\u00e0\u00a6\u00be [ca] catal\u00c3 [cs] \u00c4\u008de\u00c5\u00a1tina [da] dansk [de] Deutsch [el] \u00ce\u00b5\u00ce\u00bb\u00ce\u00bb\u00ce\u00b7\u00ce\u00bd\u00ce\u00b9\u00ce\u00ba\u00ce\u00ac [eo] Esperanto [es] espa\u00c3\u00b1ol [fa] \u00d9\u0081\u00d8\u00a7\u00d8\u00b1\u00d8\u00b3\u00db\u008c [fr] fran\u00c3\u00a7ais [he] \u00d7\u00a2\u00d7\u0091\u00d7\u00a8\u00d7\u0099\u00d7\u00aa [hr] hrvatski [hu] magyar [id] Indonesia [it] italiano [ja] \u00e6\u0097\u00a5\u00e6\u009c\u00ac\u00e8\u00aa\u009e [ko] \u00ed\u0095\u009c\u00ea\u00b5\u00ad\u00ec\u0096\u00b4 [lt] lietuvi\u00c5\u00b3 [ml] \u00e0\u00b4\u00ae\u00e0\u00b4\u00b2\u00e0\u00b4\u00af\u00e0\u00b4\u00be\u00e0\u00b4\u00b3\u00e0\u00b4\u0082 [nb] bokm\u00c3\u00a5l [nl] Nederlands [pl] polski [pt-br] portugu\u00c3\u00aas [ro] rom\u00c3\u00a2n\u00c4\u0083 [ru] \u00d1\u0080\u00d1\u0083\u00d1\u0081\u00d1\u0081\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00b9 [sk] sloven\u00c4\u008dina [sq] Shqip [sr] \u00d1\u0081\u00d1\u0080\u00d0\u00bf\u00d1\u0081\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b8 [sv] svenska [ta] \u00e0\u00ae\u00a4\u00e0\u00ae\u00ae\u00e0\u00ae\u00bf\u00e0\u00ae\u00b4\u00e0\u00af\u008d [tl] Tagalog [tr] T\u00c3\u00bcrk\u00c3\u00a7e [uk] \u00d1\u0083\u00d0\u00ba\u00d1\u0080\u00d0\u00b0\u00d1\u0097\u00d0\u00bd\u00d1\u0081\u00d1\u008c\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b0 [zh-cn] \u00e7\u00ae\u0080\u00e4\u00bd\u0093\u00e4\u00b8\u00ad\u00e6\u0096\u0087 [zh-tw] \u00e7\u00b9\u0081\u00e9\u00ab\u0094\u00e4\u00b8\u00ad\u00e6\u0096\u0087 BACK TO TOP \u25b2 \u201cThe Free Software Foundation (FSF) is a nonprofit with a worldwide\nmission to promote computer user freedom.
