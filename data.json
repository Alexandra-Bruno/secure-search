These domains may be used as illustrative\nexamples in documents without prior coordination with us. They are not\navailable for registration or transfer.\nWe provide a web service on the example domain hosts to provide basic\ninformation on the purpose of the domain. These web services are\nprovided as best effort, but are not designed to support production\napplications. While incidental traffic for incorrectly configured\napplications is expected, please do not design applications that require\nthe example domains to have operating HTTP service.\nFurther Reading\n\nIANA-managed Reserved Domains\n\nLast revised 2017-05-13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain\u00a0Names\n\n\nRoot Zone Registry\n.INT Registry\n.ARPA Registry\nIDN Repository\n\n\n\n\nNumber\u00a0Resources\n\n\nAbuse Information\n\n\n\n\nProtocols\n\n\nProtocol Registries\nTime Zone Database\n\n\n\n\nAbout\u00a0Us\n\n\nNews\nPerformance\nExcellence\nArchive\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IANA functions coordinate the Internet\u2019s globally unique identifiers, and\n                are provided by Public Technical Identifiers, an affiliate of\n                ICANN.\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
