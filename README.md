# Secure-Search
Our purpose for this project to create a private search engine. We will ensure user anonymity while delivering relevant search results. Unlike traditional search engines, it does not track, store, or profile users, prioritizing security and confidentiality.

## Features
* No Tracking: No cookies or user profiling.
* Secured data: Encryption to protect search queries for each session
* Simple Desgn
* Safe from Javascript hacking 

## How it works? 
* Our seach engine uses inspiration from Duckduckgo and displays aroung 10 resutls of your searched query
* Automatically crawls websites on the application rather than storing them in a data.json
